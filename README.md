This project implements a stock prediction model using Python and machine learning techniques. 
It leverages the yfinance library to fetch historical S&P 500 data, which is then used to train a Random Forest Classifier. 
The model incorporates several features engineered from the historical data, including moving average trends and ratios, to predict whether the stock market will go up or down the next day.
The project also includes functionality to save the data to a CSV file for faster loading in subsequent runs. 
The goal is to provide a basic framework for stock market prediction that can be further expanded and improved upon.
